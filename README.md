# Chromebook-Linux-SSH-Server
How to enable an SSH Server on a Chromebook running the Linux Development Environment

from your linux terminal:

1) Open ssh config file
   `vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

   find the line with `#Port 22`
   press 'i' to enter interactive move. Remove the # and change the port to something above 1024. I used port 2222.

   it should now read something like `Port 2222`
   press escape, then type :wq and press enter.

2) Remove the ssh_not_to_be_run file
   `mv /etc/ssh/ssh_not_to_be_run /etc/ssh/ssh_not_to_be_run.bak`

3) Restart the service
   `systemctl restart ssh`

   you may want to restart the container instead (this is more reliable):
   press Find + Esc keys to bring up the chromebook task manager, now select 'Linux Virtual Machine: termina' and press end process.

4) Go to a machine you wish to ssh into the chromebook and generate a new ssh key. I sshed into my other computer (a mac) and used `ssh-keygen -t rsa` to create a key set in my ~/.ssh/ folder, then ran `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. I then copied the output excluding the host information at the end (i.e. you@localhost...). you may want to copy this file to a usb to transfer it over, email it to yourself and open it on your chromebook.

5) On your chromebook create a file called "authorized_keys" in your local .ssh folder and place the key in it.
   `echo "ssh-rsa <paste your key here, e.g. right click the terminal window>" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

6) Enable port forwarding for the port you selected earlier by clicking the time in the bottom right of the screen then selecting the settings cog. select advanced > Linux development environment > Port forwarding > add. Add the port you added to the config file earler and if you wish give it a name, like 'SSH-server'. Click add.

7) Log in using the computer you created the keys on by running `ssh -p <port number> <chromebook login>@<chromebook IP>`

## Notes:
- you may need to run some commands as sudo, use as required.
- you may also use sshfs to access files, if you wish.
- results may vary, this is what worked for me as of 15th October 2023 running on a Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5.
